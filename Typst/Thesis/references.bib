  abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising porous materials for various applications, which have attracted considerable attention recently. Optimizing their thermal properties, such as their heat accumulation characteristics during the adsorption of fluid molecules, is crucial for enhancing their performance. Molecular dynamics studies are vital for meticulously understanding the thermal transport of MOFs. To determine the thermal conductivity of MOFs using the Green–Kubo formula through equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD), the heat current autocorrelation function (HCACF) must be truncated at a specific time. However, few studies have been conducted on establishing a method for truncating HCACFs for MOFs, rendering it challenging to assess the reliability of MOF thermal conductivities calculated through EMD. In addition, previous studies focused on the overall thermal conductivity, and the contribution of the components have not been identified. In this study, we devised a method for determining the truncation time of an HCACF to calculate the thermal conductivity of MOFs. After confirming the validity of the method, we decomposed the instantaneous heat flux into individual components and obtained the decomposed thermal conductivities. The results revealed that the contribution of the interaction of atoms was more pronounced than that of the microscopic convection of atoms. In addition, the method introduces an ambiguity while calculating the thermal conductivity of MOFs through EMD. The proposed method is useful for truncating of HCACFs and determining the thermal conductivity of complex materials such as MOFs.}

A highly porous metal coordination polymer [Cu3(TMA)2(H2O)3]n(where TMA is benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) was formed in 80 percent yield. It has interconnected [Cu2(O2CR)4] units (where R is an aromatic ring), which create a three-dimensional system of channels with a pore size of 1 nanometer and an accessible porosity of about 40 percent in the solid. Unlike zeolites, the channel linings can be chemically functionalized; for example, the aqua ligands can be replaced by pyridines. Thermal gravimetric analysis and high-temperature single-crystal diffractometry indicate that the framework is stable up to 240°C.}

In addition to the usual VLE calculations for pure CO2 and N2, calculations of the binary mixtures with propane were used in the force-field development to achieve a good balance between dispersive and electrostatic (quadrupole–quadrupole) interactions. The transferability of the force fields was then assessed from calculations of the VLE for the binary mixtures with n-hexane, the binary mixture of CO2/N2, and the ternary mixture of CO2 /N2/propane. The VLE calculations were carried out using configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in either the grand canonical ensemble with histogram–reweighting or in the Gibbs ensemble.},

A direct comparison with experimental data is made. Three popular CO2 force fields (MSM, EPM2, and TraPPE) and two flexible models (based on EPM2) were investigated. All rigid force fields accurately predict the equation of state for carbon dioxide for the given range of variables. They can also reproduce the thermal conductivity of CO2 at room temperature and predict a decrease of the thermal conductivity with increasing temperature. At high temperatures, the rigid models underestimate the thermal conductivity.},

  abstract={Porous solids with highly microporous structures for effective carbon dioxide uptake and separation from mixed gases are highly desirable. Here we present the use of polyethylene glycol (20,000 g/mol) as a soft template for the simple and rapid synthesis of a highly microporous Cu-BTC (denoted as HKUST-1). The polyethylene glycol-templated HKUST-1 obtained at room temperature in 10 min exhibited a very high Brunauer--Emmett--Teller (BET) surface area of 1904 m2/g, pore volume of 0.87 cm3/g, and average micropore size of 0.84 nm. However, conventional HKUST-1 exhibits a BET surface area of 700--1700 m2/g confirming the advantages of using this method. X-ray powder diffraction and electron microscopy analysis confirm the formation of highly crystalline and uniform octahedral particles with sizes ranging from 100 nm to 120 {\textmu}m. Adsorption isotherms recorded at temperatures between 273 and 353 K and pressures up to 40 bar revealed a more favorable adsorption capacity of HKUST-1 for CO2 vs. CH4 and N2 (708 mg (CO2)/g, 214 mg (CH4)/g and 177 mg (N2)/g at 298 K and 40 bar). The Langmuir, isotherm model, and isosteric heats of adsorption were evaluated. The CO2 interaction at PEG-templated HKUST-1 is physical, exothermic, and spontaneous with DH{\textdegree}{\thinspace}={\thinspace}{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}6.52 kJ/mol, DS{\textdegree}{\thinspace}={\thinspace}{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}13.72 J/mol, and DG{\textdegree}{\thinspace}={\thinspace}{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}2.43 kJ/mol at 298 K at 40 bar. The selectivities in equimolar mixtures were determined as 53 and 24, respectively, for CO2 over N2 and CH4. CO2 adsorption--desorption tests reveal high adsorbent reusability. The cost-effective and quickly prepared PEG-templated HKUST-1 demonstrates high efficacy as a gas adsorbent, particularly in selectively capturing CO2.},

              This raises the question whether a new experimental or predicted

Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials have potential value in the field of gas adsorption storage because of their high specific surface area, good porosity, and adjustable pore structure. In this study, the structural design and synthesis methods of MOFs are introduced, and the research progress and problems associated with MOF materials in methane storage and capture are reviewed. The current research status of methane storage at high pressure is introduced in terms of volumetric and gravimetric uptake. For methane capture at atmospheric pressure, emphasis is placed on CH4/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation and methane capture technologies. Finally, the problems and challenges of using MOF materials to achieve efficient methane storage and capture are analyzed and future prospects are presented.}
